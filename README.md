# SGQL Schemas

This repository is used to define the schemas of all the entities that can be written in Myne's Semantic Graph.

## Table of contents

- [Event](./src/event.md)
- [File](./src/file.md)
- [Folder](./src/folder.md)
- [Me](./src/me.md)

## Usage

We enforce the documentation-as-source paradigm with the use of markdown as our main language for the schemas, which are then parsed and loaded into Myne's Core.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome, although its process is yet to be defined.

Feel free to get in touch in the meantime.
