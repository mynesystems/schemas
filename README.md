# SGQL Schemas

This repository is used to define the schemas of all the entities that can be written in Myne's Semantic Graph.

## Table of contents

- Nodes
  - [Event](src/nodes/event.md)
  - [File](src/nodes/file.md)
  - [Folder](src/nodes/folder.md)
  - [List](src/nodes/list.md)
  - [Me](src/nodes/me.md)
- Relations
  - [Contain](src/relations/contain.md)
  - [Create](src/relations/create.md)
  - [Upload](src/relations/upload.md)

## Usage

We enforce the documentation-as-source paradigm with the use of markdown as our main language for the schemas, which are then parsed and loaded into Myne's Core.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome, although its process is yet to be defined.

Feel free to get in touch in the meantime.
